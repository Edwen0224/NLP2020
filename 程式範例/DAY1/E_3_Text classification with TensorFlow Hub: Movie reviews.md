"""## Build the model

The neural network is created by stacking layers—this requires three main architectural decisions:

* How to represent the text?
* How many layers to use in the model?
* How many *hidden units* to use for each layer?

In this example, the input data consists of sentences. The labels to predict are either 0 or 1.

One way to represent the text is to convert sentences into embeddings vectors. We can use a pre-trained text embedding as the first layer, which will have three advantages:

*   we don't have to worry about text preprocessing,
*   we can benefit from transfer learning,
*   the embedding has a fixed size, so it's simpler to process.

For this example we will use a **pre-trained text embedding model** from [TensorFlow Hub](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub) called [google/tf2-preview/gnews-swivel-20dim/1](https://tfhub.dev/google/tf2-preview/gnews-swivel-20dim/1).

There are three other pre-trained models to test for the sake of this tutorial:

* [google/tf2-preview/gnews-swivel-20dim-with-oov/1](https://tfhub.dev/google/tf2-preview/gnews-swivel-20dim-with-oov/1) - same as [google/tf2-preview/gnews-swivel-20dim/1](https://tfhub.dev/google/tf2-preview/gnews-swivel-20dim/1), but with 2.5% vocabulary converted to OOV buckets. This can help if vocabulary of the task and vocabulary of the model don't fully overlap.
* [google/tf2-preview/nnlm-en-dim50/1](https://tfhub.dev/google/tf2-preview/nnlm-en-dim50/1) - A much larger model with ~1M vocabulary size and 50 dimensions.
* [google/tf2-preview/nnlm-en-dim128/1](https://tfhub.dev/google/tf2-preview/nnlm-en-dim128/1) - Even larger model with ~1M vocabulary size and 128 dimensions.

Let's first create a Keras layer that uses a TensorFlow Hub model to embed the sentences, and try it out on a couple of input examples. Note that no matter the length of the input text, the output shape of the embeddings is: `(num_examples, embedding_dimension)`.
"""

embedding = "https://tfhub.dev/google/tf2-preview/gnews-swivel-20dim/1"
hub_layer = hub.KerasLayer(embedding, input_shape=[], 
                           dtype=tf.string, trainable=True)
hub_layer(train_examples_batch[:3])

"""Let's now build the full model:"""

model = tf.keras.Sequential()
model.add(hub_layer)
model.add(tf.keras.layers.Dense(16, activation='relu'))
model.add(tf.keras.layers.Dense(1))

model.summary()

"""The layers are stacked sequentially to build the classifier:

1. The first layer is a TensorFlow Hub layer. This layer uses a pre-trained Saved Model to map a sentence into its embedding vector. The pre-trained text embedding model that we are using ([google/tf2-preview/gnews-swivel-20dim/1](https://tfhub.dev/google/tf2-preview/gnews-swivel-20dim/1)) splits the sentence into tokens, embeds each token and then combines the embedding. The resulting dimensions are: `(num_examples, embedding_dimension)`.
2. This fixed-length output vector is piped through a fully-connected (`Dense`) layer with 16 hidden units.
3. The last layer is densely connected with a single output node.

Let's compile the model.

### Loss function and optimizer

A model needs a loss function and an optimizer for training. Since this is a binary classification problem and the model outputs logits (a single-unit layer with a linear activation), we'll use the `binary_crossentropy` loss function.

This isn't the only choice for a loss function, you could, for instance, choose `mean_squared_error`. But, generally, `binary_crossentropy` is better for dealing with probabilities—it measures the "distance" between probability distributions, or in our case, between the ground-truth distribution and the predictions.

Later, when we are exploring regression problems (say, to predict the price of a house), we will see how to use another loss function called mean squared error.

Now, configure the model to use an optimizer and a loss function:
"""

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss=tf.keras.losses.BinaryCrossentropy(from_logits=True),
              metrics=['accuracy'])

"""## Train the model

Train the model for 20 epochs in mini-batches of 512 samples. This is 20 iterations over all samples in the `x_train` and `y_train` tensors. While training, monitor the model's loss and accuracy on the 10,000 samples from the validation set:
"""

history = model.fit(train_data.shuffle(10000).batch(512),
                    epochs=20,
                    validation_data=validation_data.batch(512),
                    verbose=1)

"""## Evaluate the model

And let's see how the model performs. Two values will be returned. Loss (a number which represents our error, lower values are better), and accuracy.
"""

results = model.evaluate(test_data.batch(512), verbose=2)

for name, value in zip(model.metrics_names, results):
  print("%s: %.3f" % (name, value))
