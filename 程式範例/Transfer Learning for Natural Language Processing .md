Wiki word vectors
https://fasttext.cc/docs/en/pretrained-vectors.html
We are publishing pre-trained word vectors for 294 languages, trained on Wikipedia using fastText. 
These vectors in dimension 300 were obtained using the skip-gram model described in Bojanowski et al. (2016) with default parameters.

Please note that a newer version of multi-lingual word vectors are available at: Word vectors for 157 languages.
